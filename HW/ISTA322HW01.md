# Homework Chapter 01, ISTA-322
## ISTA-322, ASP.NET MVC
### Readings
#### Read chapter 1, pages 1 - 10 in the Pro ASP.NET MVC 5 book.
##### Discussion Questions
###### Answer the discussion questions in writing for chapter 1.
1. What year was ASP.NET introduced?
- 2002.
2. Briefly describe ASP.NET Web Forms.
- Web Forms applications can be written in any programming language which supports the Common Language Runtime,
the main building blocks of Web Forms pages are server controls, which are reusable components responsible for rendering
HTML markup and responding to events. A technique called view state is used to persist the state of server controls
between normally stateless HTTP requests.
3. Briefly describe ASP.NET.
- ASP.NET is an open-source server-side web application framework designed for web development to produce dynamic
web pages developed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites, applications and services.
4. Briefly describe .NET.
- .NET Framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It
includes a large class library named as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability
(each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages.
5. What is Representational State Transfer (REST)? This will take some independent research.
- Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints
to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called RESTful
Web services (RWS), provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet.
6. What is Agile Development? This will take some independent research.
- Agile software development is an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve
through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s).
It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages
rapid and flexible response to change.
7. What is unit testing?
- Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program
modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether
they are fit for use.
8. What year was ASP.NET MVC introduced?
- First introduced in 2007, first released 2009
9. Describe URL routing. As part of your answer, discuss the concept of \clean URLs."
- URL Routing is the process of intercepting an incoming Web request and automatically redirecting it to a different URL.
Clean URLs, also sometimes referred to as RESTful URLs, user-friendly URLs, or search engine-friendly URLs, are Uniform
Resource Locators (URLs) intended to improve the usability and accessibility of a website or web service by being immediately
and intuitively meaningful to non-expert users.
10. What is the relationship between Microsoft's .NET platform and ASP.NET MVC?
-  .NET is BYTECODE, the two main languages targeting .NET are C# and VB.NET. ASP.NET is an extension to the provided .NET
library to enable applications written in C# or VB.NET(or other .NET targeted languages) to work as a website.
11. Chapter 1 does not discuss the MVC pattern specifically, and in a sense this entire course is an extended
examination of the MVC pattern. Using an independent resource (such as Wikipedia) briefly state the
responsibility of (a) the model, (b) the controller, and (c) the view.
- A model represents the state of a particular aspect of the application. A controller handles interactions and updates
the model to reflect a change in state of the application, and then passes information to the view. A view accepts necessary
information from the controller and renders a user interface to display that information.
